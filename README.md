# XT Laravel Starter for Joomla

Composer is the leading application-level package manager for PHP. It has been designed for situations where the development team has full control of the environment. In multi-user systems, where independent developers create packages, the Composer usage is not recommended due to the possible conflicts.

In this starter project, an extension for Joomla is built to render a simple Laravel view, with a Tailwind CSS design.
